            <p>
                Liubov is a pastry chef with experience creating different types of culinary products. 
                From simple traditional cookies to elaborately decorated cakes – Liubov is certain to 
                come up with a masterpiece. Her inspiration takes origin from family cookbooks, cooking 
                classes and – most importantly – her creative mind. She considers herself a “forever student”, 
                never missing a chance to learn a new skill and never ceasing to amaze.

                Most recently, her desire for knowledge has brought her to Paris, where she met 
                the chefs from <i>“The Ritz”</i> for a master class of <i>Madeleines</i> – famous French treats. 
                Next year, Liubov is planning to pursue her studies in Canada and further expand 
                the knowledge of the culinary world.
